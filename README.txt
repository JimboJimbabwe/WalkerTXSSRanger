This is a touch based XSS Payload testers, that was almost made as a meme more or less.

The idea is that all things leading up to the XSS testing process is why we automate it

tests in this manner. Burp is a 3000 USD Program, so why not see if we can do it ourselves?


1.) Move main exe file from dist into WalkerTXSSRanger folder
2.) Install Requirements
3.) Start/double click the EXE
4.) Open the webpage of interest
5.) Hit Enter once Adblock is off
6.) Follow the instructions


IMPORTANT: ONCE THE SCRIPT IS RUNNING DO NOT MOVE MOUSE. Nothing bad will happen, its just counterintuitive and can produce anomalies.
